Style runs that were enabled for users coming from Biome 1.x are no longer
re-enabled by the migration script, because that would be undesirable for users
coming from 2.0.

Users who are upgrading from Biome 1.x are therefore advised to first upgrade to
Biome 2.0, before continuing to Biome 2.1 or later.
